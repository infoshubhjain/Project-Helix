# Contributing to Project Helix

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

## How to contribute

1. **Fork** the repository and clone your fork.
2. **Create a branch** for your change: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature` or `fix/your-fix`.
3. **Make your changes** and keep commits focused and clear.
4. **Run the app** to verify: `./run.sh` and optionally `python3 test_app.py`.
5. **Push** to your fork and open a **Pull Request** against `main`.

## Code style

- **Python:** Follow PEP 8; use `snake_case` for functions and variables.
- **JavaScript/CSS:** Use `kebab-case` for file names (e.g. `browse-events.js`).
- **Commits:** Use present tense and a short summary (e.g. "Add pagination to events list").
