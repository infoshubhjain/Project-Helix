Known for an immaculately crafted but endlessly surprising sound, the group has returned with\u00a0Arcadia, their first album since the 2011 masterpiece\u00a0Paper Airplane\u2014a multiple Grammy Award-winning LP that debuted at #1 on the Billboard Country, Bluegrass, and Folk Album charts. They may not have released an album in 14 years, but Krauss never stopped thinking about the next Union Station project or gathering songs that might fit. \u201cOver the years, you'll hear something, but it's not time for it,\u201d she says. \u201cYou say to yourself, \u2018Oh, this is beautiful, I'm going to set it aside and wait. I have a place behind my desk with songs that I collect, including CDs and cassettes of songs I've kept for 30, 40 years.\u201d Still, she needed the one song that would bring things into focus, that felt like a starting point, before she would pick up the phone and start mobilizing the band. \u201cUsually, I find something that's a first song\u2014\u2018Here's the beginning\u2019\u2014and then things fall into place. That song was \u2018Looks Like the End of the Road.\u2019 Jeremy Lister wrote it, and he\u2019s one of my favorites. It just felt so alive \u2014 and as always, I could hear the guys already playing it. We\u2019ve always been very grateful as a band to have come across such beautiful songs through the years and to be like-minded enough to create this life together.\u201d The members of Union Station are a team of virtuosos, all with thriving solo careers. Krauss (fiddle, lead vocal) signed to Rounder Records at age 14 and has gone on to sell over 12 million albums, earning 27 wins and 44 nominations from the Grammy Awards. Jerry Douglas (Dobro, lap steel, vocals), Ron Block (banjo, guitar, vocals), and Barry Bales (bass, vocals) are all award-winning players, songwriters, and producers who have worked with and are considered some of the greatest musicians in the world. While reassembling for\u00a0Arcadia, there was a crisis to address: Dan Tyminski informed the band that after thirty years as Union Station\u2019s guitarist and vocalist, he was not returning and would be solely focused on pursuing his solo career. \u201cThe four of us met when Dan left,\u201d says Krauss, \u201cand Jerry asked me, \u2018What do you think?\u2019 I said, \u2018Russell Moore,\u2019 and they all said, \u2018Absolutely!\u2019\u201d\u00a0 As the frontman of Russell Moore & IIIrd Tyme Out, Moore is the most awarded male vocalist in the history of the International Bluegrass Music Association. Krauss remembers seeing him play when she was a teenager, during Moore\u2019s early days with Doyle Lawson and Quicksilver, and recalls it as \u201ca very big deal.\u201d She claims that she didn\u2019t think Moore would take her up on the offer to join Union Station, but then there he was.\u00a0 \u201cI couldn't believe it when we went into the studio and his voice came through the speakers,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just stands there and sings with his hands in his pockets, and he kills it. The first song he did was \u2018Granite Mills\u2019 and about 10 minutes in, Ron was covering his mouth because he started giggling. Russell came in and inspired us all.\u201d Though most of the songs on\u00a0Arcadia\u00a0are contemporary\u2014written by such modern masters as Robert Lee Castleman, Viktor Krauss, Bob Lucas, JD McPherson and Sarah Siskind\u2014for Krauss they evoke the history and sensibility of a bygone America. \u201cThe stories of the past are told in this music,\u201d says Krauss, who was honored in 2019 with the National Medal of Arts, the highest honor given to artists by the United States government. \u201cIt's that whole idea of \u2018in the good old days when times were bad.\u2019 There's so much bravery and valor and loyalty and dreaming, of family and themes of human existence that were told in a certain way when our grandparents were alive. I think we naturally dream about that time\u2014at least I do.\u201d She points to one of the songs, the Civil War ballad \u201cRichmond on the James,\u201d as an example of the power and immediacy these compositions contain. \u201cThere's something about hearing a woman telling the story of a soldier,\u201d she says. \u201cIt reminds us how young they were\u2014they were just kids, and they had such passion, and they were excited to go and to be of service and to be a hero and so innocent. There was no way to know what they were getting into. Even though the story is so dark, the innocence is so beautiful at the same time.\u201d Krauss mentions that she drew much inspiration for\u00a0Arcadia\u00a0from a familiar source. \u201cI\u2019ve always been enamored with Norman Rockwell and that whole look, because in my mind, that's where all bluegrass tunes take place,\u201d she says. \u201cI used to stare at those paintings as a kid, in a coffee table book we had, and my mom had to explain to me they were paintings. When you get older, you learn they were to encourage people, he was painting to present an idyllic life and offer hope.\u201d \u201cWith a lot of these tunes, you hear these tragic stories, but they combined it with a beautiful melody and poetry.\u00a0 It was how people got their true-life stories told and I'm always drawn to the truth.\u201d For Krauss, returning to a more traditional approach after spending so much time recording and touring with Robert Plant (including 2021\u2019s acclaimed\u00a0Raise the Roof, the follow-up to 2007\u2019s\u00a0Raising Sand, which won the Grammy for Album of the Year) put her back on familiar and hospitable ground. \u201cThis is where I live and come from, and now I get to bring my experiences with Robert back to Union Station, just like all of the guys do with recording, producing and performing outside of the band\u201d she says. As Alison Krauss & Union Station gear up for their first tour together in ten years, Krauss is excited about the musical challenges and rewards of working with her magnificent bandmates, and about the new directions they explore on\u00a0Arcadia. But she\u2019s also aware of the importance, even the responsibility, of being a standard-bearer for roots music and keeping these songs alive.","htmlLink":"https://www.statefarmcenter.com/events/detail/akus","location":"State Farm Center 1800 S 1st St, Champaign, IL 61820","tag":"Free Food \ud83c\udf55","start":"2026-09-13T19:30:00-05:00","end":"2026-09-13T22:30:00-05:00"},"12":{"description":"","tag":"Athletics","htmlLink":"https://fightingillini.com/sports/football/schedule","summary":"Football Game: Illinois VS.
